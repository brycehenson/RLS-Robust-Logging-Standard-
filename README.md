# SLOGS (structured logging standard)
**[Bryce M. Henson](https://github.com/brycehenson)**
Defining a standard for logging data to a json structure and providing a matlab and python interface.

## Name change
- The name SLOG already exists I should come up with another.
  - .ESLOG
  - . 


## design philosophy
- human and machine readable
- language agnostic
- verbose
- widely usable, from a single computer to 1000's




## example log
example_log_20190402T141013.txt
here i show a line that is  (structured)[http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/] for human reading. // denotes comments
```json5
{
  "time_iso": "2019-04-02T14:10:13.110+11:00", // mandatory with local time zone, YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssÂ±hh:mm
  "time_posix": 1.55417461311E+9,//mandatory UTC time
  "level": "log", //mandatory, 'log','ERROR','data','analysis' 
  "environment": { //optional for all but first line of each log file
    "tier": "development", //'development','testing,'model','production'
    "architecture": "win64",

  },

## Design Notes & Questions
- want to be suitable for 100Hz logging
- [x] what should the extension be 
  - decided on .slog
- [ ] for multi machine logging how to aviod name collisions of logs.
  - what about just computer name
    - its a pretty shit network that has duplicate computer names
	- what about the same VM image
  - mac
    - macs can hop
	- not very human readable
	- collision very unlikely
- am i missing important fields
  - needs device type
- how to designate that a file is done being written too
  - double newline
  - log entry saying closed file
    - will require some code to get the last entry
- how to open a new log
  - want to limit a given log size for faster reading
- how to seek to specific times
  - log should have a closing time so that the range can be established
    - eg. "unnamed_log__20200328T200148.543+1100_to_20200328T200223.977+1100.slog"
    - what is the rename time and use penalty
    - time cost about 1.5ms
	- if file is open then wont be able to move
	  - will need to build a copy and tag that file for deletion
	- provides a done writing functionality
  - could use the last line entry but this imposes a penalty by having to open every file
